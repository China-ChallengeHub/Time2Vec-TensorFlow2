## Time2Vec: Learning a Vector Representation of Time

This is a try to implement of the paper 
[Time2Vec: Learning a Vector Representation of Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05321) in TensorFlow 2 & Keras.

### Prerequisites

At least TensorFlow (Tested on Python 3.6.9 & TF 2.2.0)
for using layers.py or models.py directly.

For run.py, numpy 1.18.5 & pandas 1.1.1 needed.  

### Data used

Currently tested on dataset: [Water Levels in Venezia, Italia on Kaggle](
https://www.kaggle.com/lbronchal/venezia#Punta_Salute_1983_2015.zip
). Download from Kaggle and extract all files to Time2Vec/data.

###### TODO:
1. Test on more dataset including those used in the paper to ensure the model correctness.
